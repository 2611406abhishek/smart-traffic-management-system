# Smart Traffic Management System Simulator

## Objective

This project is a **C++ application** designed to simulate and optimize traffic flow in a smart city. It uses modern **object-oriented design**, **advanced algorithms**, and **modern C++ features** to provide a realistic and efficient traffic management simulation.

---

## Features and Concepts Covered

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Classes and Objects**: `Vehicle`, `TrafficSignal`, and `Road` classes.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Implement different types of vehicles (e.g., `Car`, `Bus`, `Bike`) using inheritance.
- **Encapsulation**: Keep critical properties private with public getter/setter methods.
- **Abstraction**: Use interfaces or abstract base classes for extensibility.

### **STL (Standard Template Library)**
- Use containers like `vector`, `map`, and `priority_queue` for managing vehicles, signals, and routes.
- Apply algorithms (e.g., `std::sort`, `std::accumulate`) for optimization tasks.

### **File Handling**
- Read and write simulation configurations, traffic data, and results using file streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`).

### **Concurrency and Multithreading**
- Use `std::thread` and `std::mutex` to manage traffic signal changes and vehicle movements in parallel.
- Implement synchronization to avoid race conditions.

### **Templates and Generic Programming**
- Create template classes for managing queues (e.g., a `PriorityQueue` for vehicles based on urgency).

### **Smart Pointers**
- Use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` for memory management of dynamically allocated objects.

### **Error Handling and Exception Management**
- Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid input files, traffic jams) using `try-catch` blocks.

### **Design Patterns**
- **Observer Pattern**: Notify vehicles of traffic signal changes.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Centralized traffic control system.

### **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- Implement shortest-path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra) for route optimization.
- Use priority queues for managing vehicle priorities at traffic signals.

### **Modern C++ Features**
- Use `auto`, lambda functions, and range-based for loops for concise and modern coding.
- Leverage `constexpr` for compile-time calculations and `std::chrono` for time handling.

## Modules

### **Simulation Engine**
Simulate vehicle movement across a city grid with roads, intersections, and traffic signals.

### **Vehicle Management**
Generate vehicles dynamically with properties like speed, size, and priority.

### **Traffic Signal Control**
Simulate adaptive traffic lights that change based on traffic density.

### **Optimization**
Use algorithms to optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and reduce waiting times.

### **Visualization (Optional)**
- ASCII art for console visualization.
- Integration with GUI libraries like SFML or Qt for advanced visualization.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Modern C++ (C++17/20).
- **Libraries**: Boost (for advanced data structures), SFML/Qt (for visualization), JSON for Modern C++ (for configuration files).
- **Version Control**: GitHub/GitLab for tracking progress.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Install a C++ compiler supporting C++17 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- Install `CMake` if you want to build using a build system.
- Optionally, install `Boost`, `SFML`, or `Qt` for extended functionality.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-traffic-simulator.git
   cd smart-traffic-simulator
   ```

2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -pthread src/main.cpp -o traffic_sim
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./traffic_sim
   ```

### Input File Format (`roads.txt`)
- Specify roads as `FROM TO DISTANCE` (e.g., `A B 5.0`).

### Output
- Shortest path results will be written to `output/shortest_path.txt`.

---

## Example Configuration

### Input File (`roads.txt`):
```
A B 5.0
B C 4.0
A C 10.0
```

### Output File (`shortest_path.txt`):
```
Shortest Path:
A B C
```

- Improve road modeling by adding lane management and vehicle overtaking.
- Incorporate machine learning for predictive traffic signal control.
- Extend vehicle models to include autonomous behavior.
